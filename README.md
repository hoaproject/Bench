Hoa is a **modular**, **extensible** and **structured** set of PHP libraries.
Moreover, Hoa aims at being a bridge between industrial and research worlds.

# Hoa\Bench

This library allows to analyze performance of algorithms or programs by placing
some “marks” in the code. Furthermore, this library proposes some
[DTrace](http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/) programs.

## Quick usage

We propose a quick overview of two usages: the library itself and one DTrace
program.

### Benchmark

All we have to do is to place different marks in the code. A mark can be
started, paused, stopped and reset. The class `Hoa\Bench` proposes a quick
statistic graph that could be helpful:

    $bench = new Hoa\Bench();

    // Start two marks: “one” and “two”.
    $bench->one->start();
    $bench->two->start();

    usleep(50000);

    // Stop the mark “two” and start the mark “three”.
    $bench->two->stop();
    $bench->three->start();

    usleep(25000);

    // Stop all marks.
    $bench->three->stop();
    $bench->one->stop();

    // Print statistics.
    echo $bench;

    /**
     * Will output:
     *     one    ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||    77ms, 100.0%
     *     two    ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||                    51ms,  66.0%
     *     three  |||||||                                           11ms,  14.4%
     */

More operations are available, such as iterating over all marks, deleting a
mark, filters marks etc.

### DTrace

An interesting DTrace program is `hoa://Library/Bench/Dtrace/Execution.d` that
shows the call trace, errors and exceptions during an execution. For example, if
we consider the `Dtrace.php` file that contains the following code:

    <?php

    function f ( ) { g(); h(); }
    function g ( ) { h();      }
    function h ( ) {           }

    f();

Then, we can run DTrace like this:

    $ exed=`hoa core:resolve hoa://Library/Bench/Dtrace/Execution.d --no-verbose`
    $ sudo $exed -c "php Dtrace.php"
    Request start
         2ms ➜ f()        …/Dtrace.php:007
        37ms   ➜ g()      …/Dtrace.php:003
        26ms     ➜ h()    …/Dtrace.php:004
        28ms     ← h()
        37ms   ← g()
        44ms   ➜ h()      …/Dtrace.php:003
        25ms   ← h()
        30ms ← f()
    Request end

Another program shows statistics about an execution: each function that has been
called, how many times, how long the execution has taken etc.
